/// <summary>
/// Measures a fixed workload that touches none of this library, so that timings taken on
/// different machines can be compared.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every release is benchmarked in its own CI job, and a job lands on whichever shared runner is
/// free — an x86-64-v3 or v4 host, at whatever clock its neighbours leave it. That difference is
/// routinely larger than the changes a release makes, so a chart of raw times across releases
/// mostly plots the runner.
/// <para>
/// This benchmark is the fixed point that makes the rest comparable. It is integer arithmetic over
/// a value the JIT cannot fold away, chosen because it has no allocation, no library code, and no
/// dependence on anything that changes between versions — so its measured time is a reading of the
/// machine and nothing else. Dividing a benchmark's time by this one's, taken in the same job,
/// cancels most of the difference between hosts. `scripts/benchmark-history.cs` records it on
/// every entry and plots the ratio rather than the nanoseconds.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It follows that this method's body must never change. Editing it silently rescales every
/// comparison drawn against history recorded before the edit.
/// </para>
