/// <para>
/// Every other class here answers "how long does this operation take", which is only readable next
/// to something. This one supplies the something: the primitive a caller would otherwise have
/// used. The same class, with the same loops and the same methodology, is in ktsu.PreciseNumber and
/// ktsu.Semantics, so the three answers are comparable with each other as well as with
/// <see cref="double"/>. Against ktsu.PreciseNumber in particular the difference is what
/// significance tracking adds, since this type is built on that one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The bare method is the BenchmarkDotNet baseline, so the answer is the <c>Ratio</c> column rather
/// than two rows divided by hand. A ratio here is not expected to be 1.00 and is not a defect when
/// it is not: every operation pays twice, once for the arbitrary-precision arithmetic and again for
/// rounding the result back to the significance the operands justify, and both are costs paid for
/// something a <see cref="double"/> cannot do at all. What the number is for is watching that cost
/// across releases.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why these are loops.</b> A single operation over operands that do not change is
/// loop-invariant, and the JIT hoists it out of the measurement entirely — for
/// <see cref="double"/> that leaves a method indistinguishable from an empty one, and a ratio
/// against an empty method means nothing. Here each iteration feeds the next, so there is nothing
/// to hoist and both sides are measurable.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Which way the loop biases the answer.</b> Both sides pay the same counter and branch, and it
/// is a dependency chain, so most of that overlaps the arithmetic; whatever does not is added
/// equally to numerator and denominator and pulls the ratio toward 1.00. A ratio here is therefore
/// a floor on the real cost rather than the whole of it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the operands stay bounded, and why they are short.</b> The number underneath carries as
/// many digits as the arithmetic produces, so a chain that compounded its operand would measure
/// that growth rather than the operation; both loops accumulate instead. The operands are also
/// chosen to be values a <see cref="double"/> can hold, so the two sides are doing the same
/// arithmetic on the same numbers rather than being handed different problems. How the cost grows
/// with digits is a different question, and <see cref="ArithmeticBenchmarks"/> answers it across
/// its <c>Digits</c> axis.
/// </para>
